## Application and Architecture Explanation

This cloud-native e-commerce application includes multiple microservices that work together:

- **frontend-bestbuy**: A web-based user interface for customers to browse and purchase products.
- **productservice-bestbuy**: Handles product listings and inventory.
- **orderservice-bestbuy**: Manages customer orders.
- **storeadmin-bestbuy**: Admin portal to manage catalog and store settings.
- **makelineservice-bestbuy**: AI-powered service that generates product descriptions and images using GPT-4 and DALLÂ·E.
- **aiservice-bestbuy**: Additional AI utilities.
- **mongodb**: Stores product and order data.
- **Azure Service Bus**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services like order processing and makelineservice.

The application is containerized and deployed using Kubernetes for scalability and ease of management.

##  Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone Repositories**  
   Clone each microservice repo. for deployment.

2. **Build Docker Images**  
   For each service:
   ```example:
   docker build -t bestbuy-aiservice ./aiservice_bestbuy
   docker tag bestbuy-aiservice:latest nidhi0152/bestbuy-aiservice:latest
   docker push nidhi0152/bestbuy-aiservice:latest
   ```

            - name: ORDER_QUEUE_PASSWORD
              value: "fQWy3YXUPlNz8WYcG8//5SolwJRRaNZp6+ASbMCPnw4="
   ```
4. **Configure Kubernetes Manifests**  
   Apply Kubernetes YAML configuration files including deployments, configmaps, and secrets:
   ```example:
   kubectl apply -f aps-all-in-one.yaml

   ```
5. **Use Kubectl to get pods and service and Access frontend and store admin with exposed URL**
```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
```
