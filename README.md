## Application and Architecture Explanation

This cloud-native e-commerce application includes multiple microservices that work together:

- **frontend-bestbuy**: A web-based user interface for customers to browse and purchase products.
- **productservice-bestbuy**: Handles product listings and inventory.
- **orderservice-bestbuy**: Manages customer orders.
- **storeadmin-bestbuy**: Admin portal to manage catalog and store settings.
- **makelineservice-bestbuy**: AI-powered service that generates product descriptions and images using GPT-4 and DALLÂ·E.
- **aiservice-bestbuy**: Additional AI utilities.
- **mongodb**: Stores product and order data.
- **Azure Service Bus**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services like order processing and makelineservice.

The application is containerized and deployed using Kubernetes for scalability and ease of management.

##  Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone Repositories**  
   Clone each microservice repo. for deployment.

2. **Build Docker Images**  
   For each service:
   ```example:
   docker build -t bestbuy-aiservice ./aiservice_bestbuy
   docker tag bestbuy-aiservice:latest nidhi0152/bestbuy-aiservice:latest
   docker push nidhi0152/bestbuy-aiservice:latest
   ```
3. **Setup Azure Service Bus**
   Update the relevant service configuration with the Azure Service Bus connection string.
   ```example:
   - name: ORDER_QUEUE_URI
              value: "amqp://bestbuy.servicebus.windows.net" # servicebus connection string
            - name: ORDER_QUEUE_USERNAME
              value: "listner"
            - name: ORDER_QUEUE_PASSWORD
              value: "fQWy3YXUPlNz8WYcG8//5SolwJRRaNZp6+ASbMCPnw4="
   ```
4. **Configure Kubernetes Manifests**  
   Apply Kubernetes YAML configuration files including deployments, configmaps, and secrets:
   ```example:
   kubectl apply -f aps-all-in-one.yaml

   ```
5. **Use Kubectl to get pods and service and Access frontend and store admin with exposed URL**
```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
```

## Issue encontared
1.  **Deplying AI Service**
   - While deploying open AI error encoured : Insuffiencient Quota
   - How ever when I used it previously for that same project I was able to deploy but at that time those services were not working and I thought to give a next try and deleted. Unfortunaly when I tried to create open ai again insufficient quota error  was coming.
   -  I asked for a help to friend and some how I was able to retrive my openai project made previously; and my gpt4 service was deployed and for dall-e-3 it was giving error as insufficient quota. To run these ai service I have taken below steps :

###  `secrets.yml`: Added Encrypted API Key

```yaml
data:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "Qzd3dFdEazd4anJSTVdwdUJyNGkxeVc0a0dnbXhhdHJjTXpZMkYxVWZkUUt2cGdrbkhWV0pRUUo5OUJEQUNIWUh2NlhKM3czQUFBQUFDT0dJZmdr"
```
  
### aps-all-in-one.yml: Gave endpoints of AI services and entered the service names

  ```yaml
- name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME # required if using Azure OpenAI
              value: "gpt-4"
            - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT # required if using Azure OpenAI
              value: "https://desa0-m9ktnwfl-eastus2.openai.azure.com/"
            - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DALLE_ENDPOINT
              value: "https://desa0-m9ktnwfl-eastus2.openai.azure.com/"
            - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DALLE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
              value: "dall-e-3"
   ```
2. **Azure Service bus**
 - It was taking a bit long to reflect the chnages after checking out from cart and i have mentioned that in video as well. Moreover in video you can see some order spkies around 1:04am as I already tried it before recording video.
